Use this photo of me to create a photorealistic action‑figure toy, full‑body, standing upright in a clear blister‑pack packaging. 
The packaging header should read “[YOUR NAME] Starter Pack” with a subheading “(funny tagline or descriptor)”. 
The box backing should be [YOUR CHOICE OF COLOR or THEME]. 
Include three molded accessory compartments with: [ACCESSORY 1], [ACCESSORY 2] and [ACCESSORY 3]. 
Make it look like a premium collectible toy—realistic plastic textures, light reflections, cinematic, hyper‑detailed product‑photography style.
